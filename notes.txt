- ghc-options in cabal file w/ new cabal now?
  - requires cabal 3.8 which isn't even in nixpkgs yet
  - hold off for now

- ghc 9.4 when it's in nixpkgs

makefile
--------
* gnumake as flake dep
* aliases for build, repl, ghcid, format
* would like to support hlint w/ apply but might be too hard...

todo
----
- add external repo example
- maybe more docs about commands, upgrading, etc.?

CI Redux
--------
- how to handle stack? we still need to update lock file
- either add this to flake.nix
- or maybe have nix/cabal nix/stack that gives the tools / whatever
